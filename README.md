# KMLPoints
Quick (n'dirty) way to extract points from Google Maps KML files

This solution was quickly thrown together for a single purpose - to quickly extract the point information in a KML file - for use elsewhere.

While it *could* have been done using SharpKML (https://github.com/samcragg/sharpkml) I just used xml functionality of .NET to extract
what I was looking for and leave. 

Future thoughts:
Internal notes will indicate that I wanted to make it more automatable - and did a little initial JSON work before pausing dev on this
and pushing to my public repos...
